        Throughout my academic journey, I have taken many programming and mathematical courses.
        Due to this, I have deep understanding of many Programming languages. These Include C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and more.
     My experience spans various tech-related positions where I have develop excellent collaborative and leadership skills. 
     In my free time, I enjoy watching sports and listening to music. I also enjoy hanging out in nature and going on long hikes.
     I have spent time building many projects. One of my favorites is a hangman game. Although most people find it difficult, I enjoyed making that game.
     Whether I’m coding or spending time outdoors, I’m always looking to learn and grow, blending my love for technology with my other interests.

                Over five years, I have developed proficiency in various programming languages. Although I do not have technical experience in the field, I have participated in activities showcasing my programming skills. These include activities that require programming, theoretical, problem-solving, and time-management skills. One activity was the 2024 SFU hackathon. These events have helped me progress and learn as a programmer. Additionally, I have achieved a 4.11 GPA over three calculus courses. Thus, I actively peer tutor students struggling with math or programming courses. Click on the book icon to learn more about SFU hackathon.

            I have built many projects over time. They vary in difficulty. Most of my projects are made from CSS, HTML, and Javascript.
            However, I have built projects using Python and other programming languages. Some projects I have built are a weather website and a hangman game.
            In my free time, I love to make projects. In the future, I look forward to collaborating with others to create new projects. Below, I have linked my projects.
            The game icon leads to my hangman game. The sun icon leads to my weather website. Please ensure to use a laptop while viewing them.

<h1 id = "futuregoalh1"> Future Goals</h1>
<p id = "futuretext">
While learning to program, I developed a passion for game development. In the future I aspire to become a software developer. In my first programming class, 
 I learned the basics of Java. I got to create my first video game. It was a snake game. From this, experience
 I learned how much  I enjoy programming. However,
I also enjoy learning about cyber crime. I would also like to persue a career in cyber security.
I am eager to apply my skills and continue learning in a dynamic tech environment. 
Whether it is a collaborative project, internship opportunity, or full-time role, I am ready to 
contribute and grow.
