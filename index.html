        Throughout my academic journey, I have taken many programming and mathematical courses.
        Due to this, I have deep understanding of many Programming languages. These Include C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and more.
     My experience spans various tech-related positions where I have develop excellent collaborative and leadership skills. 
     In my free time, I enjoy watching sports and listening to music. I also enjoy hanging out in nature and going on long hikes.
     I have spent time building many projects. One of my favorites is a hangman game. Although most people find it difficult, I enjoyed making that game.
     Whether I’m coding or spending time outdoors, I’m always looking to learn and grow, blending my love for technology with my other interests.

            Over five years, I have developed proficiency in various programming languages. Although I do not have technical experience in the field,
            I have participated in activities showcasing my programming skills. These include activities that require programming, theoretical, problem-solving,
            and time-management skills. One activity was the 2024 SFU hackathon. These events have helped me progress and learn as a programmer. Additionally, I have
            achieved a 4.11 GPA over three calculus courses. Thus, I actively peer tutor students struggling with math or programming courses. Click on

            I have built many projects over time. They vary in difficulty. Most of my projects are made from CSS, HTML, and Javascript.
            However, I have built projects using Python and other programming languages. Some projects I have built are a weather website and a hangman game.
            In my free time, I love to make projects. In the future, I look forward to collaborating with others to create new projects. Below, I have linked my projects.
            The game icon leads to my hangman game. The sun icon leads to my weather website. Please ensure to use a laptop while viewing them.
