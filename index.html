        Throughout my academic journey, I have taken many programming and mathematical courses.
        Due to this, I have deep understanding of many Programming languages. These Include C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and more.
     My experience spans various tech-related positions where I have develop excellent collaborative and leadership skills. 
     In my free time, I enjoy watching sports and listening to music. I also enjoy hanging out in nature and going on long hikes.
     I have spent time building many projects. One of my favorites is a hangman game. Although most people find it difficult, I enjoyed making that game.
     Whether I’m coding or spending time outdoors, I’m always looking to learn and grow, blending my love for technology with my other interests.</p>
